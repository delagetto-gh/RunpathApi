## Description

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of one development task that takes an average of about 30 minutes.

- [x] The task should be completed with an appropriate level of unit testing.
- [x] Your code should trend towards being SOLID.
- [x] Your code should compile and run in one step*
- [x] Your solution should be written in C#, using .NET Full Framework or .NET core
- [x] Your solution may use MSTest, NUnit or XUnit
- [x] You may use additional frameworks/libraries/packages as needed.

#### Task

Create a Web API that when called:
* Calls, combines and returns the results of:
  * http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos 
  * http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

* Allows an integrator to filter on the user id â€“ so just returns the albums and photos relevant to a single user.
Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you! The Runpath Dev Tea
